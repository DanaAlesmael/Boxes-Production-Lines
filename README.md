# Boxes-Production-Lines

In this task, boxes should be should be separated based on their dimenssions. Two various designes were sketch to finalize the best one; the description of each design can be found below: 

In Design-1: 
* A roation part should be designed to connect the production line with storage-boxes. This rotation part should be moved based on the coming box dimenssions.
*  Ultrasonic sensor should be added to estimate the coming box dimenssion which would lead to the movement of the moving part. This was done to allow the right placement of the coming box in its designed storage box. 




In Design-2: 
* Three separate production lines (for largest, medium, and smallest boxes) should be designed to match the dimenssions of the boxes. 
* In the first two lines, a hole should be made. Since the first line was designed for the largest boxes, with 30x30x30 dimenssions, a middle hole size for the 20x20x20 boxes should be created. This part would allow even the smallest boxes to pass through in which they can pass to the third production line via the second hole. 
* Large storage boxes should be placed at the end of each production line. 
* All storage boxes can be placed on a movable cart with 3 floors for easier movement.
* Another way: All this can be done using only one line production which helps reduce number of components and save time. The file named (AnotherWay) demonstrates that. 
* Another way: The line production could be designed in a way that it shrinks gradually so that the largest box will not be able to go all the way to the end but instead will be placed on its storage bag. This can be seen in file named Way2.


Various considerations should be taken into account while designing Design-2 in Cinema 4D:
* Size: 3 big boxes should be placed at the end of each line to collect the movable boxes based on their dimenssions. The holes created in each line production should be larger by 2 cm for smoother and easier movement. The first line, which was designed for the largest boxes, should have a 22x22x22 hole so that the medium and smallest boxes can pass through. 
* Speed: The speed of each line should match with the movement of the boxes so that the proccess looks like professionally done.
